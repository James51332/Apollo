# Apollo

Apollo is a C++ framework written in modern C++17. It is lightweight, efficient, and has no dependencies. It aims to be a powerful code-first toolset that anyone can use. It is currently an outlet for that I use to teach myself about programming. It supports OpenGL 4.1 and runs on macOS as that is what I am using. I will definitely add support for more platforms in the future.

## Future
* Powerful Code First Ecosystem
* Content Pipeline for Loading Resources
* More Platforms...
* A Scripting Language???
